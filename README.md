We have gotten inspiration and use some code from the following sources:

https://github.com/rodaine/grpc-chat

## Running the application
### Server
- Change directory to `Hand-in3/server`.  
- Use `go run .`, this will start the server.

### Client
- Change directory to `Hand-in3/client`.  
- Use `go run . <name>`, this will start a client with the given name.
- You can now send messages with the client.
- Use `/leave` to stop the client.
